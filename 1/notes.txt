1. 'config.txt' has IP:port of all seeds in separate lines
2. main.py is designed to read the seed info from config and run all the seeds(servers) which peers can connect to
3. Do seed nodes commnicate among themselves? 
4. If a peer Im connected to dies, should I try to connect to another peer?
5. All socket operations throw exceptions which need to be handled
6. In peer.py, since we are using select call and non blocking versions of other socket calls, 
everything, including connecting to seeds happens in the while loop. Thus I'm not sure how we will randomly choose 4 peers
One solution might be to use select calls but not the blocking versions of the socket calls, this might cause peers to block every once in a while though
